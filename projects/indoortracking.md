[Castle Rush](https://github.com/johan-gras/Castle-Rush) is a tower defense game made in **Java** with the **LibGDX framework**.
The *medieval atmosphere* is reflected ingame by both the music and the sprites.
Two modes are available, the first is a *survival mode* and the second is a *multiplayer battle*.
