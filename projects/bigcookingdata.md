**[Big Cooking Data](https://github.com/johan-gras/Indoor-Tracking) is a full-stack data science project.**.

Key features of my work include (but are not limited to):
- **Scraped** over 100 000 cooking recipes from the web.
- **Pre-processed** highly inconsistent data using NLP techniques.
- **Created** new data by identifying cluster of data using kmeans, PCA and NLP...
- **Clustered** data using un-supervised ML techniques (kmeans and PCA).
- **Developed** a recommender system for recipes based on user-preferences and ingredient proximity.
- **Built** a computer vision app that automatically register shopped food items.

Key technologies used in this project: Python,Java,Fast.AI,Scrapy,Scikit-learn,Neo4J,JSF,Tomcat,NLTK
