**I'm deeply excited about building AI algorithms!**
You can check some of my open source implementations right there:
- [MuZero](): 
- [AlphaRL](): My attempt to build a Reinforcement Learning framework from scratch. Not bad. You can find better. Still proud of it!
- [Expectation-Maximisation]():
- [Kohonen](): 
- [Alpha-Beta](): Checkout my smart board game player :)
- [Q-Learning](): Learns that Q-value. In quest of the optimal policy.
- [Perceptron](): My first neural network ever, cool!
