**I'm deeply excited about building AI algorithms!**

You can check some of my open source implementations right there:
- **[MuZero](https://github.com/johan-gras/MuZero)**: Got a working implementation of MuZero a few day after...
- **[AlphaRL]()**: *My attempt to build a Reinforcement Learning framework from scratch!*
- **[Expectation-Maximisation](https://github.com/johan-gras/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/Expectation_Maximisation)**: *I'll keep it short. K-means + probability â‰ˆ EM.*
- **[Kohonen](https://github.com/johan-gras/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/Kohonen)**: *It's a self-organizing map: a kind of artificial neural network trained in a unsupervised way.*
- **[Alpha-Beta](https://github.com/johan-gras/Tree-search-algorithms)**: *Look at my smart board game player :)*
- **[Q-Learning](https://github.com/johan-gras/Q-Learning)**: *Learns that Q-value. In quest of the optimal policy.*
- **[Perceptron](https://github.com/johan-gras/Machine-Learning-Algorithms/tree/master/Perceptron)**: *My first neural network ever, cool!*
