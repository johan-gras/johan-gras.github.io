<strong>I love writing amazing & challenging pieces of software</strong> &mdash; check out <a href="/projects">my projects</a>.
My journey started at 13, building a video game in C.
And here we are, 10 years later, I'm now deeply focused on <strong>implementing exciting deep learning algorithms</strong> (in Python for sure)!

I'm addicted to soccer, <strong>travelling</strong> at any given (and non-given) moment, getting into philosophical debates,
and meeting new people :)
