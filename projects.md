This is a collection of some personal projects I've worked on that are easily viewable online. Anything that is not browser-friendly will not make the cut :(

I'm also [**available for consulting**](/shiny), so feel free to [contact me](/contact) if you'd like to work together.

## Courses

I have an interactive, online video course ["Case Studies in Shiny"](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/building-web-applications-in-r-with-shiny-case-studies) hosted on DataCamp. It's designed to give you practice building Shiny apps for real-life scenarios, while also helping your learn some advanced Shiny concepts.
